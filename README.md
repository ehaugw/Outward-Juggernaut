# Features

"The Juggernaut" implements a new skills tree with a total of 8 skill (like every other skill tree). Learning **Unyielding** or **Vengeful** changes the effect of many other skills in the skill tree, which enables large variations in "The Juggernaut" builds. The skills are as following:

**Unyielding** (Passive)

* Delays an physical damage, up to an amount equal to your protection, for 15 seconds.

**Vengeful** (Passive)

* Being damaged causes rage to build-up. Each point of damage taken before resistances result in 1% build-up.
* Be aware that learning this skill has impact on most other Juggernaut skills!

**Tackle** (Cooldown: 30 seconds, Stamina cost: 8)

* Required: Empty left hand
* Ram into your opponent! Either of you will fall. The most stable at foot will triump!

**Ruthless** (Passive)

* If **Unyielding** was learned: 

  * Armor stamina and movement penalties are reduced.
  * Damaging enemies causes **Confusion** among their allies, and may even cause them to stagger in fear.
* If **Vengeful** was learned: 

  * The effects from **Ruthless (Vengeful)** are only applied while the character is affected by [Rage](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Rage "Rage").
  * Weapon damage is increased by 30%.
  * The attack stamina cost is reduced by 50%.
  * The character can't be affected by boons other than [Rage](https://outward.fandom.com/wiki/Rage "Rage").

**Fortified** (Passive)

* Gives resistance bonuses equal to your armor protection.

**Stoicism** (Passive)

* Delays 50% of all damage taken above 15 to be delayed for 15 seconds.

**Horde Breaker** (Cooldown: 60 seconds, Stamina cost: 16)

* Does two attacks in wide archs that stagger on hit.
* Deals 1.0x weapon damage
* Deals 1.0x impact damage.
* If **Unyielding** was learned: 

  * Enemies affected by **Confusion** are knocked down.
* If **Vengeful** was learned: 

  * Enemies affected by **Pain** are **Slowed**.

**Cull** (Passive)

* Weapon attacks that would reduce a creature to less health than the weapon's base damage cause the creatures to die instead.




# Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from a jedi, but I suggest seeking out a huge guy in Berg.
